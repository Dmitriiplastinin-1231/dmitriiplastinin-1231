## Hi. I'm a react frontend developer:> 
[WARNING, bad english] Little about me: i'm 16(2022-2023), studying in class 10. My hobby is programming and hope in the future it will become my job. I started by python, but at some point, i began not to understand where to go next. And the solution to the problem was the study of the frontend: first html and css and scss, then javascript and react. Have a poor command of English. I started learning it this year (know about 400 words and don't know grammar).
